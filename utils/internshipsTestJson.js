Un program de training va fi special adaptat pentru tine astfel încât să acumulezi o mulțime de cunoștințe într-un timp relativ scurt.\r\n\r\nÎn perioada stagiului vei avea alocat un mentor cu experiență in PHP. Mentorul tău va aloca 20% din timp pentru trainingul tău. Este important pentru noi să nu te simți uitat într-un birou, așa că vei lucra exact în birou cu el.\r\n\r\n**Calificări:**\r\n\r\nCăutam colegi care să semene cu noi, cu care să ne facă plăcere să ieșim în oraș, oameni cu următoarele calități:\r\n\r\n- Pasionaţi de web şi dezvoltarea aplicaţiilor web;\r\n- Capacitatea de a înțelege și de a rezolva probleme nu tocmai ușoare;\r\n- Energie, entuziasm, versatilitate și creativitate;\r\n- Capacitatea de a comunica eficient și coerent o idee sau o problemă.\r\n\r\nPentru a fi acceptat la stagiu nu-ți trebuie experiență anterioară. Nu trebuie să fii excepțional, însă vrem să vedem că o dată ce ți-ai propus să faci facultatea o și iei în serios.\r\n\r\nÎntrucât și timpul este prețios, vom chema la interviu maxim o treime din numărul de aplicanți. Alegerea o facem exclusiv pe baza informațiilor din CV, așa că sfatul nostru este să-ți treci cât mai multe lucruri care te scot în evidență: repo-uri cu cod, projecte extra-şcolare. Informații precum liceul absolvit sau voluntariatul pe care l-ai făcut acum 2 ani pot face diferența.\r\n\r\n**Alte beneficii:**\r\n\r\nPoți veni cu bicicleta la birou și o poți parca în interior folosind rastelul protejat. Mulți dintre noi folosesc acest mijloc de transport așa că nu vei fi singurul ciudat :)\r\n\r\nLa prânz poți mânca în parc sau la unul din multele restaurante din zonă. Nu exclude posibilitatea de a avea un prânz alături de cei de la birou chiar în bucătărie.\r\n\r\nSuntem împătimiți ai cafelei așa că te putem învăța cum să-ți faci un espresso sau un ristretto. \r\n\r\nDacă vrei să înveți să cânți la chitara electrică sau știi deja, promitem  că nu ne supărăm dacă folosești instrumentele de pe hol.",

    description: "Aiming to bridge the gap between human and machine vision in the longstanding problem of 3D human face and body reconstruction from 2D imagery, the project’s goal is to build an environment for benchmarking reconstruction methods. \r\n\r\nThe project proposes the development of a software toolkit and web interface able to properly evaluate the fidelity of a 3D human face and body reconstruction, from both the modelling of the anthropometric dimensions and the preservation of the phenotypic traits (identity). The motivation comes from the fact that such methods are usually non-sensitive to face identities and strongly impacted by facial variations, but also when the reconstruction task is targeted for the whole human body, it introduces a particular group of challenges due to the skeleton structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirements may include:\r\n\r\n * Defining the API (based on photogrammetric decomposition of texture maps / UV maps) (R&D);\r\n * Defining the comparison methodology (R&D);\r\n * Developing the libraries for handling 3D models (OBJ Files and MTL File Format), 3D to 2D projections (SW);\r\n * Implementing the comparison methodology (SW);\r\n * Setting up an evaluation server (Dev Ops);\r\n * Developing a basic front end in order to access the server through via web (Dev Ops);\r\n\r\nSkills required / What you will learn:\r\n\r\n * C++ / Python Programming (mid-level / advanced)\r\n * Web Development / Networking (entry-level)",
